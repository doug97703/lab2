            <h1>about me</h1>
            <p>My name is doug. I was born and raised around Portland OR. I graduated from Gonzaga University in 2016 with a degree in broadcast journalism and english. I worked in the video production and marketing industries, before realizing it was time for a change. I'm excited by the capability of web and software development, and I want to become proficient in these skills so that I can widen the range of my abilities. Eventually, I hope to be a freelancer that can make my own schedule, and work from anywhere.</p>
